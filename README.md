<h1> Gravity Books Data Warehouse Project </h1>
<h3>1. Problem Overview</h3>
Gravity Bookstore is a fictional bookstore that needed a robust system to manage and analyze its data effectively. The bookstore had a transactional database (gravity_books) that stored information about books, customers, orders, and sales. However, the existing system lacked the capability to perform advanced analytics, generate insightful reports, and track historical changes in data. The goal of this project was to design and implement a data warehouse (gravity_books_dwh) and create Business Intelligence (BI) reports to help the bookstore gain valuable insights into its operations.

<h3>2. Project Overview</h3>
The project involved several key steps:

Modeling and building a Data Warehouse (DWH): Transforming the transactional database into a structured data warehouse using a star schema approach.

ETL Process: Developing an SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services) project to extract, transform, and load data from the transactional database into the data warehouse.

OLAP Cube Creation: Designing an SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services) project in Tabular mode to create a multidimensional cube for advanced analytics.

BI Reporting: Using Power BI to create self-service reports and dashboards for business users to explore the data and gain insights.
